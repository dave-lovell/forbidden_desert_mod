# forbidden_desert_mod

This is a mod for the board game Forbidden Desert. It's an R Shiny app.

The gameplay is identical to the orginal board game, only communication between players is severely limited - you can only see players on adjacent tiles and you can only speak to players on the same tile. You may signal to players on adjacent tiles using a limited range of emoji.
